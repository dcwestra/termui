# termui

A keyboard-driven terminal UI for [termio](https://github.com/dcwestra/termio) — the POSIX SSH connection manager.

termui wraps the termio CLI in a visual interface built with [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual), giving you a live alias list, detail panel, and quick access to every termio feature without leaving your terminal.

## What termio brings to the table

termui is a front-end. The interesting parts live in [termio](https://github.com/dcwestra/termio) — a single POSIX shell script with no runtime dependencies beyond OpenSSH. A few highlights that are worth knowing about before you decide whether to try either tool:

**Your snippet library follows you into every SSH session.**
termio lets you build a library of reusable shell commands (snippets). Bootstrap a remote host once and `Ctrl+X s` opens a fuzzy picker of your snippets directly in the remote shell — in both bash and zsh, without installing anything heavy on the server.

**Run a snippet across a whole group of hosts at once.**
Tag your aliases into groups (`homelab`, `prod`, `pi-cluster`). From termui's Snippets screen, run any snippet against every host in a group in parallel and collect the output — handy for rolling restarts, config pushes, or health checks.

**Named SSH tunnels you can start and stop by name.**
Instead of remembering `ssh -L 5432:db:5432 jumphost`, define a tunnel once (`termio tunnel add`) and start or stop it by name from the Tunnels screen. Tunnels persist across sessions and can be set to auto-start on connect.

**SSH key rotation that actually does the work.**
`k` on any alias rotates the key: generates a new key pair, copies the public key to the remote, updates `~/.ssh/config`, and optionally syncs the new key to your sync folder — all in one step.

**Your entire SSH setup syncs across machines.**
Point termio at a shared folder (NAS, Syncthing, Dropbox) and your aliases, snippets, and preferences stay in sync across every machine you work from. Key files can optionally be included as an AES-256 encrypted archive.

## Design

- **Tokyo Night** colour palette throughout
- All mutations go through the `termio` CLI — termui never writes config files directly
- Blocking terminal ops (connect, SFTP, rotate) use `app.suspend()` so the TUI cleanly hands the terminal over and reclaims it on exit
- Read-only config parsing (aliases, tunnels, snippets, history) done directly in Python for speed
